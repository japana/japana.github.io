This repository contains an Antora playbook project for building the (future) documentation site for the Asciidoctor ecosystem.
//published at {url-site}.

You can find a preview of the site at {url-site}.
*Keep in mind this URL is only temporary.*

== Documentation Structure

The documentation site is built using {url-antora}[Antora].
The content is pulled from various source repositories in the https://github.com/asciidoctor[Asciidoctor organization on GitHub].
These sources are defined in the Antora playbook file, [.path]_antora-playbook.yml_.
Each content source points to a folder in one or more branches that is structured as a documentation component, which Antora consumes.

The UI for the site is hosted in a separate repository, {url-site-ui}[docs.asciidoctor.org-ui].

== Quickstart

To generate the Asciidoctor Docs site, you first need to install {url-antora}[Antora].
Follow the {url-antora-install}[installation instructions] in the Antora documentation.
We recommend installing it globally, if possible.

Once Antora is installed, run the `antora` command on the playbook file hosted in this repository.

 $ antora antora-playbook.yml

This command will generate a site into [.path]_public/_.
Navigate to [.path]_public/index.html_ in your browser to view the site offline.

== How to Upgrade Antora in CI

This section provides instructions for how to upgrade Antora used in the Netlify CI build.

. Set the version of the Antora packages `@antora/cli` and `@antora/site-generator-default` in [.path]_netlify/package.json_.
Both packages should be set to the same version.
The version should be an exact number so we have control over exactly when it gets upgraded.

. Switch to the netlify directory and run the following command to update [.path]_yarn.lock_:

 $ yarn

. If there are new options in Antora we want to take advantage of, update the `antora` command defined in [.path]_netlify.toml_.
Otherwise, leave this file alone.

. Commit the changes to the master branch.

Netlify will take it from there.

== Hosting

This site is hosted on {url-netlify}[Netlify].
It's managed by the account info [at] this domain.

Deployment is triggered via a webhook to any branch in the git repository (configured as URL: \https://api.netlify.com/hooks/gitlab, events: Push Events, Merge Requests Events).

The deploy job on Netlify is configured by the file [.path]_netlify.toml_.
This configuration files defines certain environment variables that control the behavior of Yarn and Antora.
When the job runs, it switches to the [.path]_netlify/_ directory, runs `yarn`, then invokes `antora`.

The Netlify deploy logs for docs.asciidoctor.org can be viewed at {url-netlify-deploys}.

The site is also built nightly on Travis CI to pick up any updates to the content made during the day.
The nightly CI job, configured in [.path]_.travis.yml_, triggers the Netlify job by pinging the $NETLIFY_BUILD_HOOK url.
The $NETLIFY_BUILD_HOOK environment variable is defined in the Travis CI settings.
